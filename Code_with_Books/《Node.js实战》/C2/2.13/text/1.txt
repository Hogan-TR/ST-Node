There are more than 30 medical couples at Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, Hubei province, devoting themselves to combating the novel coronavirus and bringing hope to infected patients.

Some participated in the battle against SARS in 2003, and since the novel coronavirus epidemic broke out, they have been fighting together again. Some haven't returned home in over a month, and live at a hotel separately to avoid cross-infection.

"The battles started here, and we will definitely fight to the end," said Wu Zhiqiang, a doctor who works at the hospital's clinical laboratory.

All their stories demonstrate how great Chinese medical staff are, and how they save people's lives with bravery, persistence and love.

Let's see some of the medical couples at Jinyintan Hospital.
